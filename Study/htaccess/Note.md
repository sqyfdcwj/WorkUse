.htaccess Note

> **RewriteRule** pattern target flags

A RewriteRule can have its behavior modified by one or more flags.<br>
Flags are included in square brackets at the end of the rule, and multiple flags are separated by commas.

Each flag (with a few exceptions) has a short form and a long form.<br>

It is suggested that you use the short form and familiarize yourself with the long form.<br>
